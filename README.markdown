 Decimal Time Dashboard Widget
===============================

Decimal time. On your Dashboard. In a widget.


 Legals

Firstly, see Parts/license.txt for Apple's legal stuff.

Secondly, any images are copyright mine (ALL MINE MUHAHAHA.)
Please ask for permission if you for some unfathomable reason
want to use them outside of this widget in your own stuff.

Thirdly, the following applies to all the rest of my super
duper codes:

Seriously. Any Sumerian Time Ninja Strike Team dudes kick your
teeth in, that is your responsibility.


 Installation
--------------

Since in its infinite cleverness OS X moves the widget file,
it is recommendable to copy the decimaltime.wdgt directory
somewhere. Then hit it in Finder (console ninjas may also
apply) and you should be prompted for installation.


 Usage
-------

Figure it out.
